        <p class="text-muted">In 1538 Richard and Elizabeth Codington sold the manor of Cuddington to Henry VIII, who started building Nonsuch Palace. Henry VIII wiped away the old village of Cuddington including the old manor/mansion house and the church when he started work on Nonsuch Palace and created two parks – The Great Park and The Little Park. The Great Park was to the west of modern day London Road and covered about 911 acres – much of what is today Stoneleigh and Worcester Park. The Little Park was about 671 acres and was to the east of modern day London Road, covering what is today the land between Ewell and Cheam (including of course, modern day Nonsuch Park). The total area of the palace grounds was not just limited to the manor of Cuddington as Henry acquired about 150 acres each from the Manors of Ewell and from Malden.

        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Was estabilished in 1909</h5>
        <p class="text-muted">The Excelsior Scottish Rite Temple, also known as the Samuel French House, White Mansion, Dungarven, and Hurley Mansion, has a fascinating history. Earlier inhabitants of the Mansion include Samuel French (of Smith Kline and French Co.) and Edward Collings Knight, Sr., inventor of the Pullman sleeping car for railroads. Mr. Knight was a descendant of the Collings family for whom the borough and Knight Park are named. Dr. William Albert Davis, of Cooper Hospital in Camden and a 32nd Degree Mason, operated a maternity hospital in the White Mansion. In 1909, William Hurley, owner of a successful chain of furniture stores, purchased the estate and named it in honor of his birthplace, Dungarven, in County Waterford, Ireland.

          The property was purchased by the Excelsior Scottish Rite in 1930 for $125,000 from the estate of William Hurley. In 2003, the Borough of Collingswood entered a 50-year lease of the building owned by the Scottish Rite Freemasons. The Borough appointed the management of the venue to the Collingswood Foundation for the Arts, a registered 501(c)3. Since 2003, many repairs, renovations, and improvements have been made to the mansion, auditorium, and ballroom, all the while preserving its historic charm. During the past 19 years, more than a million guests have visited this classic venue</p>
